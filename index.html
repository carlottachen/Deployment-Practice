		<h3>This webpage will give some general information about how to deploy your application to Heroku.</h3>

		<p>
			To start off, setup your basic HTML template and link to your .css file. Enter npm init -y in your command
			line and
			install express at the root of your project directory. You may want to take a look at your package.json file
			and make any necessary edits. Next
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, create a new folder called 'server' and create an index.js file in there. Include any requires, invoke
			express, set up your endpoint, port, and listen for port.

			Add new endpoints for your different file types. Youâ€™ll need to reference these endpoints in your HTML
			instead of the
			actual file paths.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now create a new Github repository and push your new project to that Github repo. Next, sign in to Heroku
			and create a new app. Go to the 'Deploy' tab and select 'Github' for the Deployment method. Allow
			permissions and search for your project, then connect it. Now Enable Automatic Deploys and Deploy Branch.
			Click view to make sure everything is set up correctly.
